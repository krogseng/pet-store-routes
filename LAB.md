===

Create a pet store app that uses react-router to manager page state!

You can either create a backend, or just hard code source data in the app. Use of `redux` for state management is up to you.

# Routes and Wireframe of the App

Notes:

* There is a common navigation bar across all pages
* "Home" page links to Stores
* Stores is a list of all stores. Click on a store to transition
* Store shows the name and location of a given store. It has two substates:
  * a list of pets at the store, clicking on a pet takes you to that pet:
  * pet detail - the detail for a particular pet
  
  It also has a filter, a drop down with "All" and then animal types ('cats', 'dogs', 'birds', etc.). 
  If there is a filter, it should be added as a query parameter to the route
  
## Bonus 

Create a "Buy" button that adds that pet to a shopping cart. The button should appear both in list of pets as
well as pet detail. If user clicks buy again, same pet should not be added twice (but not a user error).

Add another top-level page "Cart" that displays the lists of pets in the cart. (hint: you should be able to 
re-use your pet list components (but don't show the buy button here). Clicking on a pet in the list should still navigate
back to the `/stores/store_id/pets/pet_id` route (okay if has buy button, but shouldn't duplicate).

## Rubric *20pts*
- Routes and nested routes (pet list/pet detail) to spec *6pts*
- Navigation (moving between routes) *4pts*
- Query paramters (filter) *3pts*
- Idomatic use of react router *4pts*
- Idomatic `url`'s *3pts*
